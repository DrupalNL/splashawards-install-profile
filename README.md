# Splash Awards install profile
The Splash Awards install profile is a simple starting point for teams 
organising a Splash Awards event. It provides several basic content types
and settings:
- Landingpages
- Pages
- Cases
- Sponsors

After installing the install profile, changes can be made to the specific 
implementation. The install profile is meant as a starting point. This means
there will be no upgrade path for new features added to the profile.

## Installing a Splash Awards project
The preferred way to install Lightning is using the composer installer for
the project:

```
$ composer self-update
$ composer create-project drupalnl/splashawards-installer [PROJECTNAME]
```
