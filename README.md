# Splash Awards install profile
The Splash Awards install profile is a simple starting point for teams 
organising a Splash Awards event. It provides several basic content types
and settings:
- Pages: can be used to create regular information pages.
- Articles: can be used to provide news on the homepage.
- Cases: can be used to collect case information.
- Sponsors: can be used to provide sponsor logo's and links on the homepage.

After installing the install profile, changes can be made to the specific 
implementation. The install profile is meant as a starting point. This means
there will be no upgrade path for new features added to the profile.

## Installing a Splash Awards project
The preferred way to install a Splash Awards project is using the composer
installer for the project:

```
$ composer self-update
$ composer create-project drupalnl/splashawards-installer [PROJECTNAME]
```
